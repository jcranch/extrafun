# extrafun

Functors of various sorts in Idris

Parts of this are a port of Fumiaki Kinoshita's
[Witherable](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/witherable) library
and the
[indexed-traversable](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/indexed-traversable)
library for Haskell. However, we also provide dependent versions of
those classes.
